# RL Point Kinetics Microreactor Environment

Initial implementation. Current plan:
- ~~Refactor pid solver thing~~
- ~~Env should have simulator instance~~
- ~~Randomize load over time~~
- Add ramping to random load
- Make helper gif maker easier
- Make helper model saver, run name, gif make (overarching script?)
- Document things here (in the README)
- Insert Kamal code
- Add tests?
